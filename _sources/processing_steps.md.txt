## s01_preprocessing
In the preprocessing step the raw data is validated and cleaned up if necessary.

## s02_segmentation
In this step the cleaned up raw data is segmented and a labeling image is produced.

## s03_feature_extraction
In the final step the labeling image and raw data are combined to extract features of interest (e.g. mean intensity per object).
